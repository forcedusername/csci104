Homework 2 Problem 1
a.) Every action line must start with a tab character.
b.) 
c.) The .PHONY rule guards against possible duplicates of files in the same folder as your makefile by making sure makefile
only pays attention to the ones associated with the makefile. Commands such as clean and all arent referring to any one
file but if you had a file named clean or all and you used make, not having the phony rule would confuse make (courtesy of
Stack Overflow).
d.) Options 2 and 4 are the only acceptable names for makefile.
