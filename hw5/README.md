## CSCI 104 HW 5

###Notes:
	+ Speed test did not work on my machine (when I tried to do insert on arrays, my system froze) but it worked
	+ on another system. My system is 64 bit, the other one is 32 bit so I used the 32 bit to record my times.
	+ 
	+ Same thing occurs with stacker implementation as the 32 bit machine is successfully able to process while mine 
	+ cannot successfully handle an integer greater than 5000 in the ~~(2&7&(~500000|~0)) example.
	+ 
	+ All the array list implementations are in alistimpls.h.
	+ 
	+ alist.h is hw5q3, speed_test is hw5q5, stack_template is hw5q6 stacker_implementation is hw5q7. 
	+ 
	+ Makefile is for speed_test and stacker_implementation.
	+
